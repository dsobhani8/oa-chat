# Optional UI Extensions

`oa-chat` runs as a complete standalone application with no extensions. A
downstream build may call the supported application entry point with optional
UI extensions:

```js
import {
    createChatApp,
    EXTENSION_API_VERSION,
    SLOT_NAMES
} from './publicApi.js';

createChatApp({ extensions: [] });
```

The public entry point also exports `ORG_API_BASE`, `resolveOrgApiBase`, and
`isLoopbackHostname`. A downstream integration should use this configuration
for its oa-org requests so account, ticket, and commercial APIs cannot drift
across different environments. The origin is public deployment configuration
and does not contain credentials.

Code that needs only environment configuration, without loading the application
factory, may import those three exports from `chat/environmentApi.js`. This is
the only additional supported downstream entry point.

## Extension contract

An extension declares the exact API version it supports and mounts through the
narrow context supplied by `oa-chat`:

```js
const extension = {
    id: 'example-extension',
    apiVersion: EXTENSION_API_VERSION,
    async mount(context) {
        const node = document.createElement('button');
        node.type = 'button';
        node.className = 'account-menu-item';
        node.setAttribute('role', 'menuitem');
        const unmount = context.slots.mount(SLOT_NAMES.ACCOUNT_MENU_ACTIONS, node);
        return () => unmount();
    }
};
```

The supported slots in API version 1 are:

- `sidebar.accountActions`
- `account.menuActions`
- `account.commercial`
- `modalLayer`

`account.menuActions` is rendered inside the signed-in account settings menu.
Nodes mounted there should be buttons with `role="menuitem"` and the shared
`account-menu-item` class. The core menu owns focus movement, Escape handling,
outside-click dismissal, and Account/logout actions. Extensions own their
menu-item label and destination. A dialog opened from this slot should use
`context.ui.getAccountMenuReturnTarget()` as its focus-return target because
the menu itself closes after selection. The legacy `sidebar.accountActions` and
`account.commercial` slots remain supported for compatibility.

An action rendered inside the legacy `account.commercial` slot must not stack a
second modal over Account. Capture `context.ui.getAccountMenuReturnTarget()`,
call `context.ui.closeAccount()`, and only then open the extension-owned dialog
with the captured element as its focus-return target. The close request honors
Account's protected recovery and authorization steps.

The context also provides narrow account, entitlement-ticket, ticket-tool, and UI
capabilities. `account.getSnapshot()` exposes only `isReady`, `accountId`,
`sessionVerified`, `accountScopeReady`, `ticketSyncReady`, and `status`; it
never exposes credentials or recovery material. Calling
`tickets.prepareEntitlementBatch()` without a `ticketCount`
only resumes an already-saved preparation for that scope.

Commercial membership surfaces may call the public ticket-tool capabilities
`getToolsSnapshot`, `subscribe`, `importTickets`, `exportTickets`, `shareTickets`,
`redeemAccessCode`, and `registerShortageHandler`. `subscribe` emits the same
redacted count/busy snapshot after ticket storage is ready and after local wallet updates; it never emits the
temporary zero used while IndexedDB is loading. It is the supported seam for a
downstream opt-in refill experience to notice a transition to zero. For a
signed-in account, `readyForAutomaticBilling` remains false until initial
encrypted sync succeeds; consumers must not initiate a charge before it is
true. These reuse the browser-wallet operations already used by
the standalone UI. Snapshots expose counts and busy state only; operations
return aggregate counts or the intentionally shareable split code/link, never
wallet ticket material, account credentials, billing identifiers, or inference
content.

`tickets.registerShortageHandler(handler)` is called only after a user tries to
send or regenerate a request whose synchronized wallet balance is below the
complete turn budget. Its frozen payload contains only `availableTickets` and
`requiredTickets`; it excludes the prompt, model identities, Memory context,
session identifiers, and account data. A commercial extension may use this
user-initiated signal to start a previously consented refill or present an
explicit purchase surface. The core request remains unsent, so a refill or
purchase cannot duplicate an inference request.
Signed-in core preflight does not call this handler until the account is
verified, unlocked, scope-ready, and ticket-synchronized.

`context.ui.registerTicketManagement(handler)` lets a downstream membership
surface replace the standalone ticket-code controls in the right panel with one
compact ticket-count button. The handler receives that button as the dialog's
focus-return target. Unmounting the extension restores the standalone controls,
so code redemption remains available in public builds with no extension.

Extensions must not import files under `components/`, `services/`, `domain/`,
or `application/`. Those modules are internal and may change without an
extension API version change.

An extension failure never prevents the standalone chat application from
starting. Changing a slot name, context capability, or lifecycle behavior is a
breaking extension API change.
